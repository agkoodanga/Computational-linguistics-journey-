        "## Purpose\n",
        "The Dyslexia Toolbox is a web application designed to assist individuals with dyslexia by providing tools to make reading and interacting with text easier. It aims to offer features like text analysis to identify potentially challenging words and sentence structures, along with games and exercises to help improve reading and language skills. The application prioritizes accessibility and a user-friendly interface following dyslexia-friendly design principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technologies Used\n",
        "*   **Python:** The core programming language for the application's logic.\n",
        "*   **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application and handle routes and requests.\n",
        "*   **spaCy:** A powerful open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), used here for text analysis (tokenization, sentence boundary detection, identifying words).\n",
        "*   **Google Colab:** The environment used for developing and running the application, providing a convenient platform with pre-installed libraries and easy access.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Features\n",
        "*   **Text Analysis:** Users can input text, and the application will analyze it to identify potentially difficult words (based on length) and long sentences. This can help users understand which parts of the text might require more focus.\n",
        "*   **Games/Exercises:** A placeholder is included for future implementation of interactive games and exercises aimed at improving reading and language skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "# User Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use the Application in Google Colab\n",
        "1.  **Open the Notebook:** Open this Google Colab notebook in your browser.\n",
        "2.  **Run Setup Cells:** Execute the initial code cells to install necessary libraries (Flask, spaCy) and download the language model (`en_core_web_sm`).\n",
        "3.  **Run Application Code:** Execute the code cell that defines the Flask application (`app = Flask(__name__)`, routes, and functions). This will start the web server.\n",
        "4.  **Access the Application:** Google Colab provides a local server. You will need to use a service like `ngrok` (not explicitly included in the code but a common Colab practice for local server access) or a similar method to create a public URL that forwards to your Colab environment's local server address (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Follow the instructions of your chosen forwarding service.\n",
        "5.  **Navigate:** Once you have the public URL, open it in your web browser to access the Dyslexia Toolbox homepage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Accessing Features\n",
        "*   **Text Analysis:** Click on the \"Text Analysis\" link on the homepage. You will be directed to a page where you can paste the text you want to analyze and click \"Analyze\". The results page will show the original text, identified difficult words, and long sentences.\n",
        "*   **Game/Exercise:** Click on the \"Game/Exercise\" link. Currently, this is a placeholder page indicating where game content will be added in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interpreting Text Analysis Results\n",
        "*   **Difficult Words:** The list under \"Difficult Words\" shows words from your input text that are longer than 6 characters, are alphabetic, and are not common English stop words. These are identified as potentially challenging words for users with dyslexia.\n",
        "*   **Long Sentences:** The list under \"Long Sentences\" shows sentences from your input text that contain more than 15 words. Longer sentences can sometimes be harder to process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Accessibility Features\n",
        "The application has been designed with dyslexia-friendly principles in mind:\n",
        "*   **Font and Spacing:** Uses a clear and readable sans-serif font (Arial) with sufficient line spacing for improved readability.\n",
        "*   **Color Contrast:** Employs high contrast colors for text and background to reduce visual strain.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links are clearly styled.\n",
        "*   **Basic ARIA Attributes:** Some basic ARIA attributes are included in the HTML templates (though a full implementation requires more detailed markup) to improve compatibility with assistive technologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features aim to make the interface less visually demanding and easier to navigate for individuals with dyslexia.\n",
        "\n",

It aims to offer features like text analysis to identify potentially challenging words and sentence structures, along with games and exercises to help improve reading and language skills. The application prioritizes accessibility and a user-friendly interface following dyslexia-friendly design principles.\n\n## Technologies Used\n*   **Python:** The core programming language for the application's logic.\n*   **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application and handle routes and requests.\n*   **spaCy:** A powerful open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), used here for text analysis (tokenization, sentence boundary detection, identifying words).\n*   **Google Colab:** The environment used for developing and running the application, providing a convenient platform with pre-installed libraries and easy access.\n\n## Core Features\n*   **Text Analysis:** Users can input text, and the application will analyze it to identify potentially difficult words (based on length) and long sentences. This can help users understand which parts of the text might require more focus.\n*   **Games/Exercises:** A placeholder is included for future implementation of interactive games and exercises aimed at improving reading and language skills.\n\n# User Guide\n\n## How to Use the Application in Google Colab\n1.  **Open the Notebook:** Open this Google Colab notebook in your browser.\n2.  **Run Setup Cells:** Execute the initial code cells to install necessary libraries (Flask, spaCy) and download the language model (`en_core_web_sm`).\n3.  **Run Application Code:** Execute the code cell that defines the Flask application (`app = Flask(__name__)`, routes, and functions). This will start the web server.\n4.  **Access the Application:** Google Colab provides a local server. You will need to use a service like `ngrok` (not explicitly included in the code but a common Colab practice for local server access) or a similar method to create a public URL that forwards to your Colab environment's local server address (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Follow the instructions of your chosen forwarding service.\n5.  **Navigate:** Once you have the public URL, open it in your web browser to access the Dyslexia Toolbox homepage.\n\n## Accessing Features\n*   **Text Analysis:** Click on the \"Text Analysis\" link on the homepage. You will be directed to a page where you can paste the text you want to analyze and click \"Analyze\". The results page will show the original text, identified difficult words, and long sentences.\n*   **Game/Exercise:** Click on the \"Game/Exercise\" link. Currently, this is a placeholder page indicating where game content will be added in the future.\n\n## Interpreting Text Analysis Results\n*   **Difficult Words:** The list under \"Difficult Words\" shows words from your input text that are longer than 6 characters, are alphabetic, and are not common English stop words. These are identified as potentially challenging words for users with dyslexia.\n*   **Long Sentences:** The list under \"Long Sentences\" shows sentences from your input text that contain more than 15 words. Longer sentences can sometimes be harder to process.\n\n## Accessibility Features\nThe application has been designed with dyslexia-friendly principles in mind:\n*   **Font and Spacing:** Uses a clear and readable sans-serif font (Arial) with sufficient line spacing for improved readability.\n*   **Color Contrast:** Employs high contrast colors for text and background to reduce visual strain.\n*   **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links are clearly styled.\n*   **Basic ARIA Attributes:** Some basic ARIA attributes are included in the HTML templates (though a full implementation requires more detailed markup) to improve compatibility with assistive technologies.\n\nThese features aim to make the interface less visually demanding and easier to navigate for individuals with dyslexia.\n\n## Error Handling and Security\n*   **Error Handling:** The application includes basic error handling. If there's an issue with text analysis input or if a page is not found, you will see an error message on a dedicated error page. Internal server errors are also logged and a generic error message is displayed.\n*   **Security:** Basic input sanitization is performed on the text input to help prevent simple injection attacks. Security headers are added to responses to mitigate common web vulnerabilities like clickjacking and MIME-type sniffing. Error logging helps in identifying and diagnosing issues.\n\n## Potential Deployment\nTo deploy this application on a free hosting platform (like Render, Heroku, etc.), you would typically follow these steps:\n1.  **Download Files:** Download the `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` created in the Colab environment.\n2.  **Create `app.py`:** Manually copy the core application code (Flask app setup, routes, functions) from this notebook into a new file named `app.py`. Ensure the Flask app instance is named `app`.\n3.  **Set up Repository:** Place `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and the `templates` and `static` directories into a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub).\n4.  **Deploy:** Connect your repository to your chosen hosting platform and follow their specific deployment instructions. The platform will use `requirements.txt` to install dependencies and `Procfile` to run the application.\n"
